# 💻 Canton Network

**Canton Network** is the world’s first blockchain network with built-in privacy and full interoperability, designed for real, regulated assets.

Its goal is to create a secure infrastructure where financial institutions can interact directly — without losing control over their data and while complying with regulatory requirements.

At the core of the ecosystem lies the **Global Synchronizer** — a decentralized service that provides synchronization and communication between independent blockchains within the Canton Network. It uses **BFT consensus** and is governed by an open community of independent organizations known as **Super Validators**. These participants are responsible for the reliability, security, and orderly operation of the network.

#### 🧩 Validators: The Foundation of the Network

Alongside Super Validators, **regular validators** play a crucial role — this guide is dedicated specifically to them.

**Validators** are participants operating within the Canton Network, verifying transactions, recording activity, and maintaining connectivity between users and applications.

Each validator stores only the data it needs and interacts with other nodes through synchronizers, making the network scalable and secure.

**Main responsibilities of a validator:**

* Verify transactions and confirm their validity
* Record activity and maintain data integrity
* Ensure stable connectivity between users and applications
* Participate in network upgrades and migrations

A validator’s activity and stability directly affect its rewards. The network incentivizes reliable and consistently active nodes through the **minting rewards** and **liveness incentives** mechanisms.

#### 💰 Canton Coin and Network Incentives

The native token, **Canton Coin**, is used to incentivize network participants. It maintains a balance between usage and issuance — tokens are **burned** when paying fees and **minted** again as rewards for active validators.

Thus, the more actively the network is used, the more stable and sustainable the Canton Network economy becomes.

#### ⚡ Canton Network: A Foundation for the Next-Generation Financial Infrastructure

Canton Network is building the foundation for a **decentralized yet regulated financial infrastructure** of the future.

Here, validators play a particularly vital role — they ensure the reliability and resilience of the ecosystem, forming its stability and trust.

#### 💰 Investment

The project has already received **indirect investments of around $400 million** from top-tier (Tier 1) funds — _source_.

#### ⚠️ Important

This guide describes the **general conditions and principles for setting up a Canton Network node**.

Before deployment, make sure to **read the official documentation** from the project team — it contains the only up-to-date technical requirements and setup instructions.

It is strongly recommended to **secure your wallet and private keys**, especially when running via **docker-compose**, since the default deployment configuration is highly insecure:\

Always create **regular backups of your database**:\
