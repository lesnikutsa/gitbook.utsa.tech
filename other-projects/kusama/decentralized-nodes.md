# üíª Decentralized nodes

{% hint style="info" %}
The 1KV program is ending and the Decentralized Nodes (DN) program is starting in its place. Currently, current 1KV participants have until October 31 to apply. The program will nominate about 75 Polkadot validators and about 180 Kusama validators for a period of 4 months. These numbers may change in the future due to changes in W3F stashes or due to changes in staking conditions

* A validator can charge a fee of up to 5% on Polkadot and up to 15% on Kusama

* Nodes must connect to public telemetry [https://telemetry.w3f.community/](https://telemetry.w3f.community/) No data should be hidden from telemetry. In particular, nodes should exchange at least the following information: (CPU, RAM, number of cores and whether the machine is virtual)
* Servers must meet the minimum hardware requirements described [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements)
* Each node must run on a separate server. There may be exceptions, but they are not recommended and must be justified
* Validators should never be slashed. The only exception is if the slashed was due to a client error or a general network problem

* You can't use Hetzner and Contabo
* Validators must be available to call (in English) upon request, during which they can be asked questions or asked to provide evidence of their transactions
* If a participant decides to leave the program, they must notify the Web3 Foundation via email at validators@web3.foundation at least one week prior to the node being disconnected
